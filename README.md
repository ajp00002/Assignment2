## Project Overview
This is a website that allows surfers to find their local coast to them. Not only does it find the local coasts it shows what the weather is going to be like and helps surfers pick a day to go surf with the absolute best conditions.
## Page Descriptions
On the main page of my website, it shows whoever is using the site the goals our website wants to provide. It starts out using a heading that says the name of my website. After this, it has three header threes to show what our main goals are and a paragraph about each goal. Another aspect of the home page is that I have written in CSS to create borders, fill in those borders, and capitalize the goals. I have created a button on the first page to hide a picture of the coastlines if it is too large for anyone. Lastly, I have an anchor that goes on to show what Coastline weather we support on the website.

Once you go onto the second page you can see a header showing the coastlines. At first glance, you can see that there is a table that shows the coasts that we support and shows all the states that are connected to part of the coastline. Also, on this page, I have added a search bar that people can use to type in their address to find the coastline closest to their location.
## Research Summary
### Website 1 https://www.weather.gov/ 
After examining the National Weather Service for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration I can see that the website's sole purpose is to help people by providing weather data. When first entering the website, you can see and click on almost every feature on the site. Whenever I click on an option, I notice it goes to another web page because the URL gains new information. For example, whenever I click on Forecast, I see /forecastmaps added to the URL. Another thing that caught my attention is the ability on the site to search for a specific area. This caught my eye because whenever I do this and click on the area question marks can be found in the URL. Also, after inspecting the webpage I noticed that there was no use of bootstrap to be found. 

### Website 2 https://oceanweather.com
After examining Ocean Weather a user can see its purpose is providing weather for each different body of water and what the weather will make the water do. Immediately after accessing this website, it is completely different from the website I previously viewed, since many of the pictures on the website do not do anything when clicked on. The only way to go to different websites is to click on the headers like Forecasting. After inspecting the website I can see that this website is much more simpler than the other website. I can’t see any use of Bootstrap, and most of the code is just a simple table created using HTML. 


### Website 3 https://www.passageweather.com/ 
After examining the Passage Weather I can see that this website is intended to be used by sailors to help them get the most accurate data for them to be able to navigate the waters the safest. This website has square boxes around the map that you can click on showing you the weather for this particular area. One thing I don’t understand about this is that whenever I click the boxes I get weather data for that area though the URL does not change. Also, after inspecting this page I can see it is also very simple just like website two. It does not appear to use any other sources like Bootstrap as well. 

### Github1 https://github.com/deep5050/minimal-weather 
After viewing this GitHub I can say it offers create ideas on how I want to structure my website. Although this website they are creating is for hunters using weather data it is still helpful for my website. After seeing the read me I’m able to see a key component that I need to have in my website, which is a search bar for the region that people can use to find their area. It also has a function in which if a user types in an incorrect area, then it results in a city not found. Also, after viewing this read, I can see the sources that the owner used, and I can see how he structured Bootstrap. Another helpful tool in their sources is an open weather source that gives the user the data to the weather which I may need to use on my website in the future. 

### Github2 https://github.com/itsMeJunaid/Weather-WebApp 
After viewing this GitHub I see that this can be a very helpful tool in helping me create my website for Coastal Conditions. Although it isn’t necessarily a website directly created to help people see the weather near beaches, I can use its structure to help me design mine. After reading the readme I can see that they use OpenWeatherMap to get accurate weather data for each location. Also, after viewing I can see how they used many different icons that I can use for mine when creating a page for local beaches and surfing weather. 
## Future Enhancements
One thing that I want to add in the future is a fully functional search location. This is because once a user searches their location, right now nothing happens. However, in the future when a user types in their location I would like it to pull up a picture of a map and show the forecast and weather within the selected location. Another enhancement in the future I would like to provide is a way to unhide the map on the front page. Another thing I would like to add to my website is the use of icons because they give the website a much cleaner look. Lastly, I want to fix the layout of my paragraphs. This is because right now I feel like they are too far apart and I haven’t been able to figure out how to move them to the correct spots I would like them to be at

## Reflection 
The main reason I used chat gpt is to get a better understanding of how to center and move different pictures. I also used it to learn how to set different prompts side by side whenever you access the website. Whenever I used some of its ways to move the texts it always had a set border that did not fit well on my website I had to go in and change the sizes of the borders and I had to adjust the coloring and font size to make it fit how I like. 
The rest of the resources I used to help me understand different aspects and learn new things to do with my website.
